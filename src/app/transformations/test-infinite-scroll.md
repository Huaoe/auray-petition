# Testing the Transformations Page

This document provides instructions for testing the transformations page functionality.

> **Note:** The infinite scrolling gallery has been moved to a dedicated page. For testing the gallery, please refer to [Gallery Test Documentation](../gallery/test-infinite-scroll.md).

## Prerequisites

1. Make sure the development server is running:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

2. Navigate to the transformations page in your browser:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/transformations
   ```

## Test Cases

### Test Case 1: Page Load

1. When you first load the page, you should see:
   - The hero section with statistics
   - The gallery section with a link to the dedicated gallery page
   - The transformation studio section

### Test Case 2: Statistics Display

1. Verify that the statistics section displays:
   - Total generations
   - Active users
   - Average generation time
   - Popular transformation

### Test Case 3: Navigation to Gallery

1. Click on the "Voir la Galerie Complète" button or the "galerie complète" link.
2. You should be navigated to the dedicated gallery page.
3. Verify that the URL is `/gallery`.

### Test Case 4: Transformation Studio

1. Click on the "Commencer ma Transformation" button.
2. The page should scroll down to the transformation studio section.
3. Verify that the transformation studio is functional:
   - You can select a transformation type
   - You can generate a transformation
   - You can share the transformation

## Browser Compatibility

Test the page functionality in different browsers to ensure cross-browser compatibility:
- Chrome
- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge

## Mobile Testing

Test the page functionality on mobile devices or using browser developer tools to simulate mobile devices:
1. Open developer tools (F12 or right-click > Inspect)
2. Toggle device toolbar (mobile icon)
3. Select different device sizes
4. Verify that the page layout adjusts responsively
5. Test all interactive elements on touch devices

## Performance Considerations

- Monitor network requests in the browser's developer tools to ensure that page resources are loaded efficiently
- Verify that the UI remains responsive on all device sizes
- Check that animations and transitions run smoothly

## Conclusion

If all test cases pass, the transformations page is working as expected. If any issues are found, check the browser console for errors and review the implementation of the relevant components.
