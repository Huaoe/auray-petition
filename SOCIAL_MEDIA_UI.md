# ðŸŽ¨ Social Media Integration - UI/UX Design

This document outlines the user interface and experience for the social media integration features.

## 1. Connecting Social Media Accounts

### 1.1. User Flow

1.  **Navigation:** The user navigates to a new "Connected Accounts" page, accessible from their user profile or a settings menu.
2.  **Account List:** The page displays a list of supported social media platforms (Instagram, Twitter/X, Facebook, LinkedIn).
3.  **Connection Action:** Each platform is listed with a "Connect" button. The user clicks the button for the desired platform.
4.  **OAuth Redirect:** The user is redirected to the social media platform's authorization screen in a new tab or popup.
5.  **Authorization:** The user logs in (if necessary) and authorizes the application.
6.  **Callback:** Upon successful authorization, the user is redirected back to the "Connected Accounts" page.
7.  **State Update:** The UI updates to show the account as "Connected," displaying the user's profile name or handle. A "Disconnect" button replaces the "Connect" button.

5.  **Image Preview:** A thumbnail of the generated image is displayed within the modal.
